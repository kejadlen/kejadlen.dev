        <h2>Flickbook on Shoes</h2>
        <p>Although using a server to sync pictures from Flickr to Facebook is by far easier to program, it is rather unwieldy when you want to actually use said tool. Even though I was the one who did the programming, getting it set up and running on the server was no fun at all. I thought this would be a fun excuse to play around with <a href="http://shoooes.net/.">Shoes</a> (It also seemed an appropriate choice, as the previous Flickbook used <a href="http://github.com/why/camping/tree/master.">Camping</a> Doing a native app using Obj-C and Cocoa also crossed my mind, but I didn&rsquo;t want to spend much time on the project, and decided to stick with my main language.)</p>

<p>Well, without further ado, <a href="http://github.com/kejadlen/flickbook/tree/master.">here&rsquo;s Flickbook v2</a></p>

<p>Some interesting bits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flickbook: 115 LOC.</li>
  <li>Flickr API: 48 LOC.</li>
  <li>Facebook API: 73 LOC.</li>
</ul>

<p>The interface is pedestrian, to say the least, but it does its job. Eventually, I&rsquo;ll have to figure out an elegant way to separate web authentication from desktop authentication in the two API libraries, but that&rsquo;s a job for another day.</p>
