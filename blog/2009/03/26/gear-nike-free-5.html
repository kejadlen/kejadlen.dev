        <h2>Gear: Nike Free 5.0</h2>
        <p>I love <a href="http://nymag.com/health/features/46213/,">walking barefoot</a> and have always wanted to get some footwear that feels closer to the experience. From what I&rsquo;ve seen online, the three most popular brands for such are <a href="http://www.terraplana.com/vivobarefoot,">Vivo Barefoot</a> <a href="http://www.nike.com/nikefree/,">Nike Free</a> and <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/.">Vibram FiveFingers</a> The Vibrams were out, since I wanted something that looked reasonably normal. I decided against the Vivos, due to a combination of their price, availability only on Terra Plana, and worries about sizing. So I turned to the Nike Free. I originally picked up a pair of the training shoes from <a href="http://www.zappos.com/,">Zappos</a> but returned them, since I wasn&rsquo;t entirely happy with them. (Side note: Zappos has possibly the best return policy I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Very easy to use, and no hassle at all. Loved it.) Eventually noticed that the Nike Free 5.0 was available from Zappos, so I got those a few weeks back.</p>

<p>I took out the included insoles, as they just added more material between my foot and the ground. The shoes also came with a guide on how best to prepare your body for wearing them, but I ignored it without any problems. (That being said, I also walk around barefoot quite frequently, so perhaps that was a mitigating factor.) This weekend, I finally took them out for some running, and it felt great. The difference between the Frees and normal sneakers is subtle, but I think the Frees are way more comfortable to run in. They held up well on the trails I ran on, which varied from dirt to mud to asphalt, depending on the section.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m very happy with them, and they&rsquo;re great for both walking around and running. Well worth the price, if a bit hard to find. (Again, highly recommend <a href="http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos</a> as a supplier.) I&rsquo;ll probably pick up another pair once this one bites the dust, but it seems pretty sturdy so far.</p>
