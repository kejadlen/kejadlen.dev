        <h2>#beachconf</h2>
        <p>At Pivotal Labs, when we&rsquo;re in between projects, we call it being on the
&ldquo;beach&rdquo;. (I&rsquo;ve heard other consultancies call it the &ldquo;bench&rdquo;, which makes more
sense to me.) While this may sound like a dream for a lot of people, we&rsquo;ve
found that most people get bored/burned out on beach after a few weeks. In
light of that, and to keep me more accountable, I&rsquo;ve decided to start keeping a
log of what I&rsquo;m doing on the beach.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This wasn&rsquo;t too informative; some nice improvements with Objective-C
interop with <code>String</code>/<code>Range</code> and copy-on-write, but I don&rsquo;t use key paths
or KVO a lot, so that was not as interesting. The addition of
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable">Codable</a> is greatly welcomed, though.</li>

      <li>While I agree pretty much completely with the overall point, I did think it
was overly harsh on math teachers.</li>

  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/245">Building Apps with Dynamic Type</a> (WWDC)
    <ul>
      <li>I&rsquo;ve always been impressed by Apple&rsquo;s accessibility support as a developer
(I do use a handful of accessibility features on iOS, but not Dynamic
Type), and it&rsquo;s cool to see Apple steadily improving in this area.</li>
      <li>Both designers and devs are going to have to adjust to constraints based on
baselines instead of the space between labels.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Poked around at <a href="https://github.com/kejadlen/kilo-rs">my implementation</a> of <a href="http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html">Build Your Own Text

</ul>

<h3 id="july-6">July 6</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Poked around a bit more with <a href="https://github.com/kejadlen/kilo-rs">kilo.rs</a>. Realized that I need to
handle <code>STDIN</code> differently, so I&rsquo;m going to let that simmer in my
subconscious for a bit before continuing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/200077718">Life After Nil</a> (video)
    <ul>
      <li>Mostly skimmed through this talk about applying concepts learned from
Haskell to Ruby. Not much new to me here, but validating to see that I&rsquo;ve
reached similar conclusions as other people.</li>

  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/412/">Auto Layout Techniques in Interface Builder</a> (WWDC)
    <ul>
      <li>Learned a few neat tricks in this talk. I like how hard Apple&rsquo;s pushing
Dynamic Type across their WWDC presentations. From my anecdotal experience,
I&rsquo;ve seen a number of people on the bus using that accessibility feature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Wrote <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-07-06-encrypting-stuff-in-git %}">a blog post on encrypting stuff in git</a>.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>So I&rsquo;ve tried reading this book in the past and have gotten past here, but
this is feeling much more understandable now that I&rsquo;ve watched some of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_">Bartosz&rsquo;s lectures on category theory</a> and read

      <li>I was volunteered to do a talk on <a href="http://pryrepl.org/">Pry</a> for work, so I have started
yak shaving by writing a presentation tool that meets my personal

  </li>
  <li>Tutoring at <a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a>
    <ul>
      <li>The current cohort is working on capstones now, so there was an impressive
breadth of technologies that I helped out with:

          <li>Getting a Parrot drone onto a WiFi network</li>
          <li>Connecting to Intuit using an npm library</li>
          <li>Redacting private information that was pushed to GitHub</li>
          <li>Using Postgres with SQLAlchemy and Alembic</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It&rsquo;s always fascinating to me that I&rsquo;m still able to contribute despite not
being an expert on many of the above areas. In the end, being exposed to
similar issues and troubleshooting is a skill that&rsquo;s broadly applicable
across all of these different problems.</li>

      <li>Yay for wireless debugging and view controllers in Xcode&rsquo;s view hierarchy,
although there was a bunch of stuff on SpriteKit and SceneKit that I&rsquo;m not
really interested in.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pry presentation
    <ul>
      <li>Finished the MVP for both the presentation tooling and the presentation

    <ul>
      <li>Played around with making this more robust and less of a one-off
experiment. Thought about making it more generic or using a Ruby DSL, but
in the end, I don&rsquo;t really need that additional complexity and would rather
keep it as simple as I can.</li>
